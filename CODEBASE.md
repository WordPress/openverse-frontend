# Codebase overview

This document will give you a high level overview of the modules and components of the application and how they work together.

## Dependencies

The Openverse frontend is built using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) as its main view library.

It uses [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) as a meta framework to handle several key functions:

- Server Side rendering in production
- Lifecycle methods for data fetching on client and server-side page loads
- Building the application for production

If something in the codebase confuses you, it may be a feature of Nuxt.js, so make sure you check out their documentation.

Nuxt.js is built on top of standard libraries in the Vue.js ecosystem. It uses [Vue-Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) as its routing library and [Vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex) as state-management library.

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is used for unit tests. [Cypress](cypress.io) for end-to-end (e2e) tests, to simulate the user experience and make sure all of our unit-tested components are working in harmony.

## Basic repository structure

### In the project root

The root of the repository contains several configuration files for code formatting, and configuration, for prettier, nuxt, docker, eslint, and other config files

[`nuxt.config.js`](./nuxt.config.js) is an important file. It contains several key pieces of configuration. You can [read more about the Nuxt.js config file here](https://nuxtjs.org/guides/configuration-glossary/configuration-build).

- environment variables are set in the `export const env = {}` object. Variables are set with camel case names like this `process.env.varNameGoesHere` and their default values are formatted in the more conventional `process.env.VAR_NAME_GOES_HERE` format.
- Default HTML metadata and Nuxt plugins are added
- `/src` All JavaScript code lives in the src directory.

## Internationalization

Internationalization (usually abbreviated as i18n) of the site is handled by [Nuxt I18n](https://i18n.nuxtjs.org) module which is integrated with the [vue-i18n](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/) plugin.

To ensure best experience for international users, make sure to take the following steps when adding new content:

- For new text content, add the translation strings to the [English locale file](./src/locales/en.json) , specifying an appropriate key. All keys should be unique. To use this text, add `{{ $t('<i18nkey>') }}` inside the template or `this.$i18n('<i18nkey>')` in JavaScript.
- For new routes and paths, use [`localePath` and `localeRoute` as the wrapper for NuxtLink](https://i18n.nuxtjs.org/basic-usage#nuxt-link), so that the correct locale path is used.
