# Play-pause toggle

<Description of={PlayPause} />

<ArgsTable of={PlayPause} />

It should be noted that the component emits the `toggle` event with the opposite
value of its `status` state. The buttons don't have any dimensions so a pair
of `h-*` and `w-*` classes are needed.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Default"
    args={{
      status: 'playing',
      class: ['h-16', 'w-16'],
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

The recommended way to use it is with `v-model` mapping to a `String` that can
either be `'playing'`, `'paused'` or `'played'`.

It should be noted that both paused and played states change to playing when
toggled whereas the playing state toggles to paused. The played state can only
be achieved by playing till the end of a track.

export const vModelTemplate = () => ({
  template: `
    <div>
      <PlayPause class="h-16 w-16" v-model="status" />
      {{ status }}
    </div>
  `,
  components: { PlayPause },
  data() {
    return {
      status: 'played',
    }
  },
})

<Canvas>
  <Story name="v-model">{vModelTemplate.bind({})}</Story>
</Canvas>

The component is a transparent wrapper over `<button>` so all attributes of the
button element can be applied to it, e.g. `disabled`.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Disabled"
    args={{
      disabled: true,
      class: ['h-16', 'w-16'],
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
